## Overview of the Challenge:
As we seek investment to support our surf and shake shop for locals and tourists in Oahu. We got a certain interest from a famous surfer, W. Aby. However, because previous investments in similar trends were unsuccessful because of the weather. Our investor has asked us to dive into the weather data for the island to see if our shake and shop have more success opportunities than his previous venture. In this analysis, we show the data for June and December to determine whether the Surf and Shake shop is sustainable all year round.

## Results:

#### Statistics June temperature

1. The data show that in June and December, the average temperature is above 70 degrees, but December shows slightly higher temperatures by 3.9 degrees.
2.  June's max temperature was 85 degrees, and December's max was 83.
3. The data show that June has a minimum temperature register of 64 degrees, while December has a minimum temperature of 56 degrees.
4. Distribution of temperature seems more spread out, while on December concentrates more towers in the middle.

## Summary:
The data show a consistent average temperature above 70 degrees, which gives an advantage to our pitch and shows stability for a future shake and surf shop. In addition, the maximum temperatures are surprisingly close. This finding is also positive for our pitch. We would have to look closely at December, as the temperatures are low, given the geographical location. This low temperature could help us prepare for staffing and inventory, as it can also affect revenue projections and therefore establish a new business plan. 

## Extra queries 
1. Reformulate our questions not only about ask about temperature, but also about precipitation, such as extreme rain, hurricanes and others. Since this can also be a big factor, and any missing information could be a potential loss of profit.
2. Not only to look for Jun and December, but also to provide data visualizations for the whole year to give us a better picture.
